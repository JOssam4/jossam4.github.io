                Imagine a typical high school classroom environment. What do you see? Students at desks paying varying degrees of attention to the teacher standing at the front of the classroom? Are the students using pencil and paper, or are they using smart devices? When they point to a passage in the assigned reading, do they open a book and rifle through the pages, or do they point at the screen? Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, schools have experimented with integrating technology into their classrooms. Pandemic lockdowns accelerated these changes and reinforced the idea that technology and education go hand-in-hand. However, the presence of technology is far more detrimental to students than many would think. High school is an important time in young adults’ lives as they learn which study strategies work for them and which subjects pique their interest. While students can use devices in ways that promote learning, they have a much higher potential for use in ways that interfere with the learning process. Thus, I claim that among high school students, digital technology within the classroom is overused, especially during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.

                To gather information about the opinions of current high school students regarding the role of technology in the classroom, I spoke to a student who currently attends the high school from which I graduated. I chose to interview this candidate because he is in his fourth year, which means he has experienced high school before, during, and after the lockdowns caused by the pandemic. Thus, he has experienced the widest variety of modalities in his high school career, which makes him an ideal candidate for this project. I will refer to this student as Mark. I found him through mutual acquaintances who were two years below me when I attended high school and two above Mark. I conducted the interview one-on-one over Zoom, and I asked him seven questions about his academic experience before, during, and after lockdown. He indicated he would be most comfortable if the meeting were not recorded, so I did my best to accurately collect his responses.

                Since his answers primarily gave insight into his personal experience, I did not need to perform much data analysis. Instead, I used his responses to paint a picture of how the high school experience has changed over the course of the pandemic, and compared it to my understanding of the pandemic from a college perspective.

                Integration of technology into the classroom acts more as a distraction than an educational tool. When asked how his engagement has changed since classes have returned in person, Mark told me that since he “can use [his] computer during class, [he finds himself] distracted and not paying attention way more than [he] used to.” He goes on to say he “definitely [has] more trouble connecting with the material than before.” Students often find themselves misusing technology meant to improve education for one amazingly simple reason: it is too distracting. Many students, Mark included, use the same device for both schoolwork and entertainment. With a practically endless supply of distractions just a few keystrokes away, it is no wonder that students quickly get distracted and disengage from class. Discipline is required to keep one’s mind on the tasks at hand instead of playing games, doing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">wordle</a>, or texting friends. Many students, specifically at the high school level, struggle to block out such enticing distractions.

                Technology’s tendency to distract students is touched upon in Bad Ideas about Writing. In the article titled The More Digital Technology, The Better, authors Genesea M. Carter and Aurora Matzke explain that “when technology isn’t mindfully incorporated into the classroom, it can become a distraction that significantly impacts learning” (Bad Ideas about Writing, 321). There is a common misconception that technology is the ‘silver bullet’ when it comes to improving students’ quality of understanding of classroom material. To improve learning outcomes, either students’ usage of technology must be monitored, or teachers should discourage device usage in class.

                The use of digital technology within the classroom sets students up for failure after graduating high school. Carter and Matzke discuss research that has shown how “children who are exposed to a lot of technology have rewired brains. They’re better at scanning for information and retrieving information, but they are less able to concentrate deeply” (Bad Ideas About Writing, 321). When they go on to college or start their careers, they will need the ability to focus deeply on tasks and see them through to completion. Thus, exposure to technology prevents their brains from learning how to do this at the stage in their lives when it is easiest for them to learn to do so. The environments surrounding college and one’s workplace are much less forgiving than the high school environment. Thus, the presence of technology in classrooms can cause students to struggle not just academically but in their careers as well.

                Switching between tasks sounds better to these students because deeply exploring a single problem can be somewhat boring. However, in my own experience, I found boredom to be incredibly beneficial in the long term. When I was in high school, one of the most difficult obstacles I had to overcome was my resistance to deep concentration on tasks. During my freshman year of high school, my parents and teachers noticed that my <a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/add-vs-adhd" target="_blank">ADD</a> caused me to get distracted far too often to the point where I struggled to complete any assignments at all. Since my brain was already wired in a way that made concentration difficult, I had to work hard at rewiring it. One of the most helpful ways I fought this condition was by keeping possible distractions to a bare minimum. Even if the content being taught did not interest me, my brain saw a choice: think about where the two mathematical functions written on the board would intersect, or be completely bored for an hour every single school day.

                After a while, I realized how much I enjoyed thinking about solutions to math problems, which helped me discover my passion for math and computer science early in my high school career. Ever since then, I have gone full steam ahead with my decision to study computer science and mathematics, and have not regretted my decision for a second. I am certain that if I had been allowed to use my computer during class, I would have spent that time playing meaningless games on the internet instead of figuring out what interested me. I am also certain that rewiring my brain to be able to concentrate on tasks deeply for long periods of time has been the most important skill in getting where I am today.

                When it comes to note-taking, students often find that using digital technology does not make things any easier than just taking notes the old-fashioned way. When asked when he thought schoolwork was easiest to complete, Mark told me he “definitely took better notes when [he] didn’t have [his] computer with [him]. Most of [his] notes now are riddled with typos, and math and science notes are almost illegible. Turns out it’s not that easy to copy down equations and drawings just by typing on a keyboard.” Students who prefer conventional note-taking applications like Google Docs or Microsoft Word tend to find jotting down drawings or mathematical notation more challenging than on pencil and paper. Certain tools can make this easier (like <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/about/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a> or certain drawing programs), but since each tool has a learning curve, students end up overwhelmed and unsure how to effectively use technology to their advantage.

                Similarly, when it comes to turning assignments in, students tend to think that the pre-pandemic route was the best. Mark told me that “before the pandemic, everything was easier. If [he] had something due, [he] printed it out or wrote in [his] answers and turned it in. When the pandemic first started, it felt like every one of [his] classes used a different platform and it was really confusing. [He] had to use Canvas, Turnitin, and Edmodo just to name a few. They made everything really complicated.” Turning a physical piece of paper in is much less stressful than submitting a file. There is a lot more room for something to go wrong when students submit all assignments online. Compared to just turning in a piece of paper with one’s work on it, online submissions are a completely different beast that not all students want to face.

                From Mark’s responses as well as research done by authors Genesea M. Carter and Aurora Matzke, one can conclude that digital technology has a far higher potential to cause harm to students than to meaningfully increase academic performance or content understood. Ever since the pandemic forced millions of Americans into lockdown, technology has been looked at almost like a ‘silver bullet’ that can solve the education system’s existing problems. Unfortunately, this approach is too naïve and does not take into account the many risks posed by the misuse of digital technology in a classroom setting. Until schools can implement policies that mitigate these risks and ensure devices’ positive impacts in the classroom outweigh the negative impacts, high school students should stick with the tried and true methods of learning, even if it means they have to pick up their pencil and paper.
