                Programming has been one of my interests since high school, if not earlier. I first learned to program to write simple scripts that would automate some repetitive tasks. Over time, it grew into a hobby that has allowed me to express my ideas and goals in a truly customized and personalized way. While the actual code I write has not changed much over the years, my workflow and the tools I rely on have. When I learned my first programming, I focused on learning the intricacies of the language first and using it to create novel applications second. The first language I ever learned is called <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>. It is a language that is easy to read and write, and quite powerful in terms of the amount of code needed to perform simple tasks, especially when compared to other languages.

                When I first learned it, I focused as much time and energy as possible on being able to write programs with as little help as possible. I would simply open a text editor like notepad (which allowed me to write code without any assistance) and manually type out my entire program. I would then save the file, run it, figure out why it did not work, and try again until it did. The entire process would often take the better part of the afternoon for simple scripts and days or weeks for more complicated programs. Over time, I found value in learning as I went along, and allowed tools to help me write programs. Changes to my development workflow over time allow me to improve as a developer while reducing the need to remember the intricacies of the languages or technologies I work with.

                Development tools provide enough help from the editor that I can get away with being rusty in the language/technology I am working with. As a computer science major, I am no stranger to being put on the spot and told to write code. However, in my computer science classes, when I was unable to use my normal development environment it would always take me much longer to write up a solution than it otherwise would have. My typical development environment includes tools that help solve simple problems that arise in many different projects. It also includes tools that help me figure out where and why my logic falls through. Some more recent (and somewhat experimental) tools allow me to describe the problem I am trying to solve and allow me to generate code on the spot that completes that task. In practice, I try to avoid incredibly advanced tools that do things like this because I find they weaken my problem-solving skills over time. However, I like having them around if I really need them. Since these tools are available to me more often than not, I can usually get away with being a little rusty with the language I am working with. Once, I was tasked with building a full-fledged mobile app in a language I had never used before. Thanks to the development tools I have at my disposal, I was able to do both simultaneously instead of first learning the language and then building the app. Development tools can provide boilerplate code that builds a basic working template of an app. From here, developers can make the changes they want to turn the template into something usable. Using a template here allows the developers to skip some of the repetitive parts of app development they may be less familiar with, which thus allows them to successfully develop without a full in-depth understanding of the language/technology.

                A lack of full understanding of the technology one uses to develop sounds like bad practice, but in reality it is pretty common. The entire point of most technological frameworks is to abstract away problems that developers might not want to think about while developing their applications. Thus, they should not need to fully understand how a framework works in order to use it effectively. This is one of the primary reasons why development tools are so helpful: because they allow developers to focus on the specifics of their applications instead of “reinventing the wheel.”

                Advancement of the tools I use to develop has allowed my workflow to become generally weaker without hindering my performance as a developer. I have been a (mostly) active developer for about seven years now. My workflow used to always begin with a well-thought-out design, after which I would pick a programming language and then, finally, implement it. Nowadays, I usually pick the language first, and design as I code. When I first started developing apps, the code itself was usually difficult to manage, so I needed to have a good design to turn to if I got lost. Nowadays, there are so many tools out there that help make code cleaner and easier to read, so I do not need to worry about getting lost or stuck nearly as much as I used to. While my new workflow might appear somewhat haphazard to onlookers, the change has been necessary. As highlighted by the authors of A Better Pencil, “the shock of the new often brings out critics eager to warn us away” (A Better Pencil, 12). One can argue that it is still best to start with a clear design and have everything else follow. The time I’ve spent as a developer has shown me that even a well-thought-out design can be misleading when working with specific technologies. Instead, it is much easier to create the design as I work.

                This workflow will most likely continue to improve as I learn the full potential of the tools I use. The tools I use are technologies in and of themselves and give me a wide variety of tools to use at my disposal as long as I know how to use them. A few years ago, I found out how my editor can track previous versions of files I’ve made and let me switch between them easily, which was quite helpful when I made a mistake and everything stopped working. Once I learned about this tool, I was able to simply jump back to where I had been before I made the mistake and remove my subsequent changes. As I explored my development environment more, I became aware of time-saving features like this, which have helped me improve my workflow. The authors of <a href="https://sculib.scu.edu/record=b3855235" target="_blank">The Digital Environment</a> allude to this in the first chapter of their book. They note that “technology grows out of culture and loops back to influence it” (The Digital Environment, 25). Due to the modular nature of modern development environments, there will likely be additional tools available to help solve problems when working with new technologies. As I become more fluent in my development environment, I predict my workflow will improve. It is important to note how my workflow is somewhat dependent on the tools I use, and that these tools require that one learn to use them. Unfortunately, tools for developers are rarely foolproof, and can sometimes cause more damage than good. For this reason, I have found that it is more important for me to focus on learning to write clean and readable code than it is for me to completely learn to use the programming environment around me. After all, the environment and tools I have at my disposal change from time to time, like when I am issued a work computer that only has access to specific tools.

                As I have gotten better at writing code, I have found myself less familiar with shortcuts in a language that do not easily translate to other languages. The focus of my work has shifted from being competent in a specific language to being competent in as many languages as possible. I have learned to use the tools available to me to make my life easier and allow me to focus my time on solving more difficult problems. I used to tackle this problem before writing any code while in the design stage, but since some of the technologies my code relies on completely change what the result of the design should look like, I have found that it is usually easier to cross that bridge when I get to it. At the end of the day, a design is just a blueprint. It cannot be run, and there is probably some error residing in it that will not become apparent until the code becomes fleshed out. Overall, I would say that the shift in my approach to programming, especially as it relates to designing, has changed for the better. While it might seem somewhat disorganized, I have found that I much prefer to have an app with concrete issues to solve instead of a design that I might end up needing to throw out anyway. The shift towards solving novel problems and away from memorizing code fragments has made my hobby and my future career much more enjoyable.
