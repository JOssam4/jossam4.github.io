                I have been programming since before high school when I learned how to automate repetitive tasks with code. Over time, it has grown into a hobby that allows me to express myself in a truly customizable way. During this time, the tools I rely upon have changed so much that my current workflow is completely different than it was when I started. The first language I ever learned was called <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, and I learned it first because it was one of the most beginner-friendly programming languages available at the time. It made writing code easy and reading it even easier. It also allowed me to perform complex tasks in only a few lines of code, which tends to be a problem for other programming languages.

                While learning the language, I focused as much time and energy as possible on being able to write programs with as little help as possible. I would simply open a text editor like notepad (which allowed me to write code without any assistance) and manually type out my entire program. I would then save the file, run it, figure out why it did not work, and try again until it did. The entire process would often take the better part of the afternoon for simple scripts and days or weeks for more complicated programs. Over time, I found value in learning as I went along, and allowed tools to help me write programs. As I allowed myself to learn as I went along, I stopped worrying about learning the intricacies of the language I was working with, and I prioritized creating cool projects with it. My experience with coding over time brings me to my thesis: changes to my development workflow over time allow me to improve as a developer while reducing the need to remember the intricacies of the technologies I work with.

                Development tools provide enough help from the editor that I can get away with being rusty in the language/technology I am working with. In my computer science classes, when I was unable to use my normal development environment it would always take me much longer to write up a solution than it otherwise would have, and not just because I can type faster than I can write by hand. My typical development environment includes tools that help solve simple problems that arise in many different projects. It also includes tools that help me figure out where and why my logic falls through. Some more recent (and somewhat experimental) tools allow me to describe the problem I am trying to solve and allow me to generate code on the spot that completes that task. In practice, I try to avoid incredibly advanced tools that do things like this because I find they weaken my problem-solving skills over time, but I like having them around if I need them. Since these tools are available to me more often than not, I can usually get away with being rusty with the technologies I work with. Once, I built a full-fledged mobile app with a language I had never used before. Thanks to the tools I had at my disposal, I was able to learn the language while building the app instead of first doing the former and then the latter. A common feature of development tools is that they can provide boilerplate code that builds a basic working template of an app. From here, developers can make the changes they want to turn the template into something usable. Using a template here allows the developers to skip some of the repetitive parts of app development they may be less familiar with, which allows them to successfully develop without a full in-depth understanding of the technology.

                Not fully understanding the technology I use to develop sounds like bad practice, but in reality it is pretty common. The entire point of most technological frameworks is to abstract away problems that developers might not want to think about while developing their applications. Thus, they should not need to fully understand how a framework works to use it effectively. This is one of the primary reasons why development tools are so helpful: they allow developers to focus on the specifics of their applications instead of “reinventing the wheel” (spending time and energy solving a problem that already has an elegant and practical solution).

                Advancement in terms of the tools I have at my disposal allows my workflow to be flexible without hindering my performance as a developer. My workflow used to always begin with a well-thought-out design, after which I would pick a programming language and then, finally, implement it. Nowadays, I usually pick the language first, and design as I code. When I first started developing apps, the code itself was usually difficult to manage, so I needed to have a good design to turn to if I got lost. Nowadays, there are so many tools out there that help make code cleaner and easier to read, so I do not need to worry about getting lost or stuck nearly as much as I used to. Instead, problems usually arise from things I would not think to include in a design in the first place anyway such as inconsistencies in the ways different technologies “speak” to each other. While my new workflow might appear somewhat haphazard to onlookers, the change has been necessary. As highlighted by the authors of A Better Pencil, “the shock of the new often brings out critics eager to warn us away” (A Better Pencil, 12). One can argue that it is still best to start with a clear design and have everything else follow. The time I’ve spent as a developer has shown me that even a well-thought-out design can be misleading when working with specific technologies. Instead, it is much more practical to create the design as I work so as not to overlook any major design flaws too early on.

                This workflow will most likely continue to improve as I learn the full potential of the tools I use. The tools I use are technologies in and of themselves and give me a wide variety of tools to use at my disposal as long as I know how to use them. A few years ago, I found out how my editor can track previous versions of files I’ve made and let me switch between them easily, which was quite helpful when I made a mistake and everything stopped working. Once I learned about this tool, I was able to simply jump back to where I had been before I made the mistake and remove my subsequent changes. As I explored my development environment more, I became aware of time-saving features like this, which have helped me improve my workflow. The authors of The Digital Environment allude to this in the first chapter of their book. They note that “technology grows out of culture and loops back to influence it” (The Digital Environment, 25). Due to the modular nature of modern development environments, there will likely be additional tools available to help solve problems when working with new technologies. As I become more fluent in my development environment, I predict my workflow will improve. It is important to note how my workflow is somewhat dependent on the tools I use, and that these tools require that one learn to use them. Unfortunately, tools for developers are rarely foolproof, and can sometimes cause more damage than good. For this reason, I have found that it is more important for me to focus on learning to write clean and readable code than it is for me to completely learn to use the programming environment around me. After all, the environment and tools I have at my disposal change from time to time, like when I am issued a work computer that only has access to specific tools.

                As I have gotten better at writing code, the focus of my work has shifted from being proficient in a specific technology to being competent in as many technologies as possible. I have learned to use the tools available to me to make my life easier and allow me to focus my time on more difficult problems. I have also learned to be careful when designing a solution to a problem before attempting to implement it. Since some of the technologies my code relies on completely change what the result of the design should look like, I have found that it is usually easier to cross bridges when I get to them. Overall, I would say that the changes in my workflow have improved my experience as a developer tremendously. Being able to shift away from memorizing the intricacies of various technologies and towards solving new and exciting problems has made my hobby and future career much more enjoyable. I only hope that this trend continues to the point where I can look back at my current workflow and feel happy I no longer have to write code in such an antiquated way.
